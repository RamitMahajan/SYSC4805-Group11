# SYSC4805-Group11
Snow Plow Project for SYSC 4805 

In this project, we are going to build a snow plowing that will consist of a moving vehicle and three plows, one at front and one on each side (right and left) of the vehicle. The plows will be retractable and extandable so as to move the snow away from the assigned area. The vehicle will also have different type of sensors on the front of the vehicle which will detect if the vehicle will come near to any obstacle or wall and will also make sure that the vehicle stays in between the assigned area.
